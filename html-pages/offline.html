    <h1>Well it looks like you're offline!</h1>
    <p>just in case you didn't know survev.io doesnt work without an internet connection so this is quite the pickle...
    </p>
    <h3>Some things you could try to remedy this are as follows</h3>
    <div id="div2">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Check your router and make sure any cables needed are connected as well as checking your router's status
                if it is shown
            </li>
            <li>
                Check your device it could be your Wi-Fi drivers are corrupted or your ethernet port / Wi-Fi reciever
                have just died...
            </li>
            <li>
                As a last resort try restarting both your device and router sometimes things just fix themselves like
                that :o
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="div1">
        <a class="button a button-hover" id="reload">Reload</a>
    </div>
    <p id="p1">In the meanwhile though you can play around with this thing</p>
    <p id="p2">(erm I haven't actually made the "thing" yet so ummm check back later...?)</p>

        document.getElementById('reload').addEventListener('click', () => {

        // Optional: auto-retry when connection comes back
