# chickenPoo's Amazing Survev Desktop App

im too lazy to write this readme right now I will do it in a day or two but you know for now just go back to the extension readme it explains almost everything and most things that apply there apply here

but just in case you are new here simply go to the release section and download the .exe then run it and if windows shows up saying "Windows just protected your PC" simply push "More info" then "run anyway" if your uncomfortable doing this go use the extension version however just know it only works on chrome and there are no auto updates...
